# 🚀 Mini Agent Workflow Engine — AI Engineering Internship Assignment

This project implements a **minimal workflow/graph engine** using **FastAPI**, created as part of the **AI Engineering Intern Case Study**.  
It supports:

- Node-based computation  
- Directed edges  
- Shared state  
- Conditional branching  
- Looping  
- Tool registry  
- Background execution  
- Execution logs  
- Example Agent Workflow (Code Review Mini-Agent)

The goal is clarity, correctness, and clean engineering — not complexity.

## 🔧 Features Implemented

### ✅ Workflow Engine
- Node definitions (Python functions)
- Directed edges between nodes
- Shared state propagation
- Conditional branching via `cond`
- Looping until condition satisfied
- Sync + async node support

### ✅ Tool Registry
- Simple rule-based tools
- Functions for extraction, complexity check, issue detection, suggestions

### ✅ FastAPI Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **POST** | `/graph/create` | Create a graph |
| **POST** | `/graph/run` | Execute a graph (background) |
| **GET** | `/graph/state/{run_id}` | Fetch execution state + logs |

### ✅ Example Workflow Implemented (Option A — Code Review Mini-Agent)
Steps:
1. Extract functions  
2. Check complexity  
3. Detect issues  
4. Suggest improvements  
5. Loop until `quality_score >= threshold`

Create a Graph
```base
{
  "nodes": [
    {"name": "extract", "fn": "node_extract"},
    {"name": "check_complexity", "fn": "node_check_complexity"},
    {"name": "detect_issues", "fn": "node_detect_issues"},
    {"name": "suggest_improvements", "fn": "node_suggest_improvements"}
  ],
  "edges": {
    "extract": "check_complexity",
    "check_complexity": "detect_issues",
    "detect_issues": "suggest_improvements",
    "suggest_improvements": {
      "cond": "state.get('quality_score',0) < state.get('threshold',80)",
      "true": "check_complexlicity",
      "false": null
    }
  }
}
```
Example Response:
```base
{
  "graph_id": "5842016015b946299e1f916a98ab4846"
}
```

Run the Graph:
```base
{
  "graph_id": "5842016015b946299e1f916a98ab4846",
  "initial_state": {
    "code": "def add(a,b):\n    return a+b\n\ndef slow(n):\n    for i in range(n):\n        print(i)\n    return n",
    "threshold": 85
  }
}
```
Example Response:
```base
{
  "run_id": "90c33c197e0045b880cc5919c1776e9b"
}
```
Check Final Execution State
```base
